## City-of-Phoenix-Vendor-Payments

#### The City of Phoenix publishes [vendor payment](https://www.phoenixopendata.com/dataset/city-checkbook) information from 2014 onward.  Each year has about half a million vendor payments (equating to over 2M rows in total), this is a fun opportunity for me to work with data at a larger scale and work through issues that might be associated with this size of data sets.  Also, the data has format differences from year to year(columns added/removed, labels changed).  This is a good oportunity to practice data wrangling in order to analyze the data as a whole.   I'm interested in:

#### 1.  Understanding how patterns of spending change from year to year
#### 2.  Identify payments that might be fraudulent
